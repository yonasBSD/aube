# Regression: `aube install` run from inside a workspace member must
# resolve up to the workspace root (pnpm parity) instead of treating the
# member as a standalone project. The user-visible bug is that a member
# install runs a fresh resolve/fetch/link cycle and writes a private
# lockfile, virtual store, and install state next to the member's own
# package.json — duplicating work the prior workspace-root install
# already did, and re-downloading anything not already in the global
# cache.
#
# Root cause: install/mod.rs's `find_project_root` walks up to the
# *nearest* package.json, which inside a workspace is the member's own.
# A workspace-aware walk should resolve to the workspace root when the
# member's ancestor is a workspace declaration.
