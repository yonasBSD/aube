# Profile-Guided Optimization build for aube, with optional BOLT
# post-link rewrite.
#
# Three-phase rustc PGO flow, plus an optional BOLT step:
#
#   1. Build aube with -Cprofile-generate (instrumented binary).
#   2. Train against the hermetic Verdaccio registry — a mix of cold
#      and warm installs of fixture.package.json — so the profile
#      covers the resolver / registry / store / linker hot paths and
#      the frozen-lockfile fast path.
#   3. Merge .profraw via llvm-profdata, recompile with -Cprofile-use.
#   4. (AUBE_PGO_BOLT=1) re-link phase 3b with `--emit-relocs`, build
#      an instrumented variant via `llvm-bolt --instrument`, replay
#      the phase 2 training workload to collect per-process fdata,
#      `merge-fdata` them, then run `llvm-bolt` again to reorder
#      blocks + split cold paths using the merged profile.
#      Layered after PGO because LLVM's PGO and BOLT optimize different
#      things — PGO drives instruction-level codegen (inlining,
#      branch weights), BOLT does post-link block/function layout
#      and cold-path splitting that LLVM can't see at IR time.
#      Instrumentation rather than perf-LBR sampling so the flow
#      works on aarch64 (no LBR/BRBE dependency) and on hosts where
#      `kernel.perf_event_paranoid` denies branch-stack sampling.
#
# Local default: target/release-pgo/aube using profile=release-pgo.
#
# Holds /tmp/aube-bench.lock for the entire run because the hermetic
# registry (port 4874), throttle proxy (port 4875), and warmed cache
# (~/.cache/aube-bench/registry) are shared across worktrees,
# terminals, and agents.
#
# CI hooks (env vars):
#   AUBE_PGO_NO_LOCK=1          skip /tmp/aube-bench.lock acquisition
#                               (also auto-skipped if `flock` is missing,
#                               e.g. on macOS).
#   AUBE_PGO_PROFILE=<profile>  cargo profile for both phases (default:
#                               release-pgo). Set to `release` in CI when
#                               the final build is delegated to another
#                               step.
#   AUBE_PGO_TARGET=<triple>    cross-compilation target (default: host).
#                               Output lands at target/<triple>/<profile>/.
#   AUBE_PGO_BUILD_TOOL=<tool>  `cargo` (default) or `cross`. cross is
#                               used in CI for Linux GNU/musl targets so
#                               the resulting binary keeps cross's older
#                               glibc baseline. Cross.toml passes RUSTFLAGS
#                               through to the container.
#   AUBE_PGO_SKIP_FINAL_BUILD=1 stop after merging .profraw. Use when the
#                               final optimized build is delegated to a
#                               separate step (e.g. taiki-e action) that
#                               picks up RUSTFLAGS+CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO
#                               from the environment.
#   AUBE_PGO_BOLT=1             append a BOLT post-link rewrite pass
#                               after phase 3b. Requires `llvm-bolt`
#                               and `merge-fdata` from a `bolt-NN`
#                               package — either on PATH or installed
#                               at /usr/lib/llvm-NN/bin/. Linux-only;
#                               BOLT's macOS support is not in tree.
#                               Uses BOLT's instrumentation mode (no
#                               `perf` needed), which works without
#                               LBR/BRBE branch sampling and without
#                               privileged kernel knobs.

#     the Namespace runners we use for PGO default to 2 and don't

#   - aarch64 hosts without ARM v9.2 BRBE can't do LBR sampling at all,
#     so the perf flow would silently miss profile data on the
#     aarch64-linux PGO row even if paranoid were 0.
# Instrumentation sidesteps both: BOLT injects counters into the binary,
# the instrumented binary writes one fdata file per process at exit,
