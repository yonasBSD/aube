//! `aube deploy` — copy a workspace package into a standalone target
//! directory and install its dependencies there.
//!
//! Mirrors `pnpm --filter=<name> deploy <target>`: we pick one workspace
//! package by name, copy the files it would publish (same selection as
//! `aube pack`), bundle any `workspace:` / `file:` / `link:` deps the
//! deployed package reaches into a staging dir under the target, rewrite
//! the deployed `package.json` to point at the bundled copies, then run a
//! fresh `aube install` rooted at the target dir so the result is a
//! self-contained project — siblings included, no registry round-trip.
//!
//! Implements the common monorepo-CI path:
//!
//!   * required `-F/--filter` (one or more pnpm-style selectors, shared
//!     with the global `-F` flag — exact names, `@scope/*` globs, path
//!     selectors, including dependency-graph selectors)
//!   * `--prod` (default), `--dev`, `--no-prod` (deploy every dep kind),
//!     `--no-optional` forwarded to install and to the manifest rewrite
//!   * single-match fanout drops straight into `<target>`
//!   * multi-match fanout stages each match into
//!     `<target>/<source-dir-basename>/` and requires `<target>` itself
//!     to be empty/missing
//!
//! Workspace siblings + `file:`/`link:` dep targets reachable from the
//! deployed package land at `<target>/.aube-deploy-injected/<id>/`. The
//! deployed manifest (and any nested bundled manifest) gets its
//! `workspace:` / `file:` / `link:` specs rewritten to relative `file:`
//! pointers at those staged copies, so install resolves them as plain
//! local-directory deps. Recursion handles siblings whose own deps are
//! workspace siblings.
//!
//! When the source workspace has a lockfile and no bundling was needed,
//! deploy prunes that lockfile to the deployed package's transitive
//! closure and drops the subset into the target before install runs — a
//! `FrozenMode::Prefer` install then reproduces the workspace's exact
//! resolved versions without re-fetching packuments. When bundling
//! happened, when there is no source lockfile, or the deployed package
//! has workspace-sibling / `link:` / `file:` roots whose rewritten form
//! diverges from the source lockfile, subsetting is skipped and a fresh
//! install runs.
//!
//! Deferred: `--legacy`.
