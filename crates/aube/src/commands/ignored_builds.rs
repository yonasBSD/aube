//! `aube ignored-builds` — print packages whose lifecycle scripts were
//! skipped by the `pnpm.allowBuilds` allowlist.
//!
//! Walks the lockfile, reads each dep's stored `package.json` from the
//! global store, and reports any package that declares a
//! `preinstall` / `install` / `postinstall` script but isn't explicitly
//! allowed by the current `BuildPolicy`. Shared with `approve-builds`,
//! which re-uses [`collect_ignored`] to drive its interactive picker.
//!
//! Pure read — no network, no writes, no project lock.
