//! Install-time progress UI built on top of `clx::progress`.
//!
//! Two modes live behind one API so call sites in `install::run` stay the same:
//!
//! * **TTY** — an animated clx bar: a root row with overall counts plus
//!   transient child rows for in-flight tarball fetches. Children auto-hide
//!   on completion via `ProgressJobDoneBehavior::Hide`, so the display stays
//!   bounded even though the pipeline resolves → fetches → links concurrently.
//! * **CI** — append-only lines safe for GitHub Actions / plain pipes: a
//!   single repeating pnpm-style `Progress:` line emitted on a ~2s
//!   heartbeat, showing `resolved` / `reused` / `downloaded` plus the
//!   byte total for the downloaded set. The heartbeat only prints when
//!   something actually advanced, so a fast install stays quiet and a
//!   slow one shows exactly *why* it's slow (network-bound vs
//!   linker-bound). No phase noise, no child rows, no redraws.
//!
//! `try_new` picks the mode: TTY on an interactive stderr, CI on a pipe,
//! or CI when `is_ci::cached()` detects a known CI environment (Buildkite,
//! GitHub Actions, etc.) even if stderr looks like a TTY — those systems
//! allocate a PTY so tools emit colors, but their log capturers strip
//! cursor-control escapes and each animation frame lands as its own log
//! line. CI mode's ~2s heartbeat is the right shape for that.
//! It returns `None` only when clx has been forced into text mode
//! (`--silent`, `-v`, `--reporter=append-only|ndjson`) — those modes own
//! their own output and we stay out of the way.

/// A `tracing_subscriber` writer that coordinates with clx so log
/// events don't get overwritten by the animated progress display.

/// Default `std::io::stderr` writes race the render loop: a `warn!`
/// emitted mid-frame lands in the middle of a redraw, leaving the bar
/// fragments smeared across the log line (and the log line smeared
/// across the bar) until the next tick repaints over it.
///
/// `PausingWriter` fixes this by buffering each event in-memory and
/// flushing the whole buffer atomically at the end of the event:
///
///   1. `make_writer` returns a fresh buffered guard — one per event.
///   2. The fmt layer writes the formatted record (level prefix,
///      message, fields, trailing newline) into the guard's buffer.
///   3. On drop, the guard takes clx's terminal lock, pauses the
///      render loop, writes the whole buffer in a single `write_all`,
///      then resumes.
///
/// Holding the terminal lock across the pause/write/resume window
/// serializes against `ProgressJob::println` and the render thread,
/// so neither can interleave half a frame mid-event. In text mode
/// (`-v`, `--silent`, append-only, ndjson) the progress display
/// isn't running; pause/resume become benign no-ops and the event
/// still flushes cleanly.
/// Print a message to stderr safely while the install progress bar
/// may be active. Direct `eprintln!` during an active bar smears
/// output across frames (bar paints over half the message, next tick
/// repaints over what remains). Use this for warnings that need to
/// surface mid-install like peer-dep errors, allowBuilds policy
/// warnings, retry notifications, etc. If no bar is up, degenerates
/// to a plain stderr write. Trailing newline is appended. Call sites
/// that already hold a bar handle can use ProgressJob::println
/// instead, but this works without one.
