//! Debounced, grouped warnings for slow registry metadata fetches.
//!
//! `fetchWarnTimeoutMs` is an observability knob: when a packument
//! takes longer than the threshold, aube wants to surface that slowness
//! so operators can spot registry latency without enabling debug
//! tracing. Emitting one warning *per* slow packument floods the
//! install output — a single throttled run can produce dozens of
//! near-identical lines. Waiting until end-of-resolve to summarize
//! goes too far the other way: the user sees nothing for tens of
//! seconds while a slow registry stalls the install.
//!
//! This module sits in the middle: a tumbling window opens on the
//! first slow event and stays open for `FLUSH_WINDOW`. Every event in
//! that window is accumulated into one group, and the window's expiry
//! flushes the group as a single `tracing::warn!`. If more events
//! arrive after the flush, a fresh window opens. The install pipeline
//! and the process-exit hook in `aube/src/main.rs` both call
//! [`flush_summary`] to drain any trailing group whose window hasn't
//! expired — install-time flush gives the user feedback before the
//! fetch phase starts; the process-exit flush catches slow fetches
//! from non-install commands (`aube add`, `aube audit`, `aube
//! deprecate`, `aube deprecations`) that don't run a resolver.
//!
//! The result: groups roughly the size of "events that arrived close
//! together in time," refreshed at the cadence of the window. The
//! `code = WARN_AUBE_SLOW_METADATA` field on each emission is
//! unchanged — CI scripts and ndjson reporters that branch on the
//! code stay working.
//!
//! Per-event detail (label + elapsed) is *not* logged at any level by
//! default. `--loglevel debug` floods unrelated DEBUG sites and isn't
//! a usable escape hatch; if structured per-package telemetry is ever
//! needed, ndjson is the right vehicle.
