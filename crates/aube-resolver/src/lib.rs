    // (matches lockfile) AND `other-a@^2` (fresh); `other-a@2.0.0`
    // declares a transitive `dep-a@^2` that no lockfile entry
    // satisfies.
    //
    // Correct behavior: resolver picks dep-a@1.0.0 for the direct
    // dep (via lockfile reuse) and dep-a@2.0.0 for the transitive
    // (via the fetch path).
    //
    // The original bug: `ensure_fetch!` wrongly skipped the spawn
    // when `resolved_versions[dep-a]` was non-empty, regardless of
    // whether the packument was actually in `self.cache`. The
    // lockfile-reuse path populates `resolved_versions` without
    // ever caching the packument, so the transitive dep-a@^2 task
    // fell through to the fetch-wait loop, called `ensure_fetch!`,
    // got skipped, and panicked with "packument fetch disappeared
    // before completing". The fix removes the `resolved_versions`
    // guard from `ensure_fetch!` — the macro now checks only
    // in-flight + cache, and prefetch gating on lockfile-covered
    // names is done by callers via an explicit `existing_names`
    // check.
    //
    // Note: this test pre-seeds the resolver cache with both
    // packuments, so the wait-for-fetch loop exits immediately
    // without actually calling `ensure_fetch!` — which means the
    // test passes with or without the fix. It's kept as an
    // end-to-end scenario assertion (resolver produces the
    // expected two-version graph) rather than a direct regression
    // test for the `ensure_fetch!` bug itself. Triggering the
    // actual bug requires a real registry mock that returns the
    // packument during the wait loop, which the unit-test harness
    // doesn't have; the BATS suite covers the end-to-end path
