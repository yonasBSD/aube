/// and for some directory deps that pre-date the modern `link: true`
/// emission. Without recognizing it, the entry parses as a plain
/// registry package; lockfile-reuse then matches by name+version and
/// the fetcher 404s on the literal package name.
///
/// Tarball vs. Directory is decided purely by the `.tgz`/`.tar.gz`
/// suffix: the lockfile path is authoritative, and we don't have the
/// project root here to stat the target. False classification is
/// recoverable on the next install — `LocalSource::parse` from the
/// manifest re-runs the FS-aware check.
