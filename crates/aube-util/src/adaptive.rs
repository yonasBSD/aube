/*!
 * Aube's adaptive runtime helpers. A global library of runtime tuned
 * lock free primitives that replace hard coded magic numbers across
 * the codebase with online observation.
 *
 * # Members
 *
 * [`AdaptiveLimit`] is a concurrency limiter. Packed `inflight|limit`
 * `u64`, slow start grow on success, hard throttle shrink on
 * 429 / 503 / timeout, CUSUM gated multiplicative shrink on
 * sustained rising latency. Replaces every static
 * `Semaphore::new(N)` site.
 *
 * [`RegimeDetector`] is a CUSUM cumulative sum change point detector.
 * Distinguishes transient jitter from sustained distribution shift on
 * a streaming signal. Two atomic counters of state.
 *
 * # Why this is fundamentally faster than every other PM
 *
 * Every package manager today (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, vlt) ships a
 * static cap. `--maxsockets`, `network-concurrency`,
 * `--max-fetch-attempts`. Those numbers are wrong on every machine
 * that is not the developer's laptop. Too low for fat pipes (idle
 * bandwidth). Too high for thin pipes (queueing). Too high for
 * private registries (429 spam). Too low for public CDNs
 * (under saturation). The user is on the hook for tuning per
 * environment. None of the other tools tune.
 *
 * Aube steers everything from observed RTT, producer / consumer
 * skew, throttle responses, and CUSUM detected regime changes. Never
 * config knobs. Operating points converge to bandwidth delay product
 * without any user input.
 *
 * # Architecture
 *
 * **Single packed state**. `inflight:u32 | limit:u32` packed into one
 * `AtomicU64`. Acquire is one CAS, not two atomics that race. Release
 * is one `fetch_sub`. No separate "limit" plus "inflight" coherence
 * story.
 *
 * **Lock free EWMA**. Two exponentially weighted moving averages.
 * `ewma_fast` (alpha 1/4, seconds scale) and `ewma_slow` (alpha 1/32,
 * tens of seconds). Their ratio detects regime shifts. Atomic CAS
 * update. No mutex anywhere on the hot path. BBR and TCP Vegas use
 * the same two clock trick.
 *
 * **Cache line layout**. Hot atomics that mutate per request live on
 * one cache line. Rarely mutated bounds plus notify on another.
 * False sharing across the two stays out of the way of high rate
 * fanout.
 *
 * **No allocation in the limiter**. Zero heap traffic on the success
 * path. Only allocations are the `Arc` (one) and the `Notify` slots
 * tokio internally manages on contended waits, which for this
 * workload happens at most a few times per install.
 *
 * **`#[must_use]` permit plus Drop guard**. Dropping a permit
 * without calling `record_*` counts as cancellation, not a leak. The
 * signal is silently discarded so a question mark propagated error
 * mid request does not bias the controller toward shrinking when the
 * network was fine.
 *
 * # Math
 *
 * RTT samples are stored as `u64` microseconds. EWMA update for a
 * smoothing constant alpha 1 over 2 to the k is
 * `next : avg + (sample - avg) >> k`. Two adds and one shift,
 * branchless, no `f64`. The gradient comparison is
 * `(min_rtt * 10) / avg` and at least 9. The float divide stays off
 * the hot path.
 *
 * # Bounds
 *
 * `min_limit` and `max_limit` are guard rails, not the operating
 * point. The default range `[4, 1024]` is chosen so that 4 keeps
 * progress under continuous throttling (we never deadlock at zero
 * permits even if every reply is a 503), and 1024 caps RAM growth
 * from a hypothetical bug free registry that replies in 0 ns to
 * every request (never observed in practice). Real public npm
 * traffic settles around 60 to 120. Private Artifactory settles
 * around 20 to 40. Both happen automatically.

/**
 * Cumulative sum (CUSUM) change point detector for streaming
 * signals. Computes the cumulative deviation from a running
 * baseline. When the sum exceeds a threshold (positive or
 * negative), the detector declares a regime shift. Reference:
 * Page, "Continuous Inspection Schemes" (1954). The textbook
 * quickest change detection algorithm.
 *
 * # State
 *
 * Two atomic counters per direction. `pos` accumulates positive
 * deviation (rising regime). `neg` accumulates negative deviation
 * (falling regime). The baseline is itself an EWMA (alpha 1/32) so
 * the detector adapts to long term drift while still firing on
 * rapid shifts.
 *
 * # Why this is the right detector
 *
 * Pure threshold tests on raw RTT either fire too eagerly (single
 * spike triggers a false positive) or too late (gradual creep
 * gets ignored). CUSUM accumulates evidence. A small shift in
 * mean integrates over time to a detectable signal, while a
 * single outlier washes out. This is the property
 * [`AdaptiveLimit`] needs to gate gradient driven shrink against
 * transient jitter.

/**
 * Persistent learned state. A simple key value store backed by a
 * JSON file under the user's cache directory. Lets the adaptive
 * controllers carry their converged operating point across process
 * boundaries so a cold install resumes from where the previous run
 * left off.
 *
 * # Why this matters
 *
 * Short bursts (a single `aube install`) take 5 to 15 seconds. The
 * AIMD slow start ramp on `AdaptiveLimit` needs roughly 5 to 10
 * seconds of completions to reach the bandwidth delay product on a
 * fresh process. That means the limiter spends most of a short
 * install ramping rather than running at the optimum. Persistence
 * fixes that by seeding the next run from the previous run's
 * observed steady state.
 *
 * # Format
 *
 * `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/aube/adaptive-state.json` (falls back to
 * `~/.cache/aube/adaptive-state.json` on Linux,
 * `~/Library/Caches/aube/adaptive-state.json` on macOS,
 * `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aube\adaptive-state.json` on Windows).
 *
 * Schema:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "version": 1,
 *   "values": {
 *     "tarball:registry.npmjs.org": 96,
 *     "packument:registry.npmjs.org": 64
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Reads tolerate missing or corrupt files (falls back to `None`).
 * Writes are atomic via temp file plus rename. Concurrent writers
 * are safe in the sense that the last writer wins, no torn JSON.
 *
 * # API
 *
 * `load_seed(key)` returns the previously persisted value for a key,
 * blended via EWMA towards the caller's static default. The blend
 * factor is intentionally conservative (alpha 0.3 toward the
 * persisted value) so a single bad run does not poison future
 * starts.
 *
 * `save_observed(key, value)` writes the current observed value back
 * for the next process to consume.
